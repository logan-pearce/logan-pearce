## Hi I'm Logan ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Arizona & Steward Observatory.  I'm interested in exoplanetary systems in multiple star systems and how the other star(s) influence the planetary regime.  I primarily explore this with high-contrast adaptive optics ground-based imaging.  I also interested in many other things you can explore with this technology that let's us look at faint things next to bright things, including finding new previously-unknown planets using the acceleration of their host stars.  I am currently working on modeling detecting and characterizing exoplanets in the light they reflect from their host star using an instrument for the upcoming Giant Magellan Telescope.  I love all things stars and planets and am easily distracted with new shiny science!

I'm from Austin Texas, and before becomming an astronomer I served 5 years as a US Navy officer (with nuclear power speciality) and 6 years as a middle school science teacher.  I have a labrador named Lani.
